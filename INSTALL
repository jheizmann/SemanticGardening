	Apache HTTP Server
	MySQL higher than 4.0.14 (Recommended MySQL 5.x)
	PHP 5.2.x (PHP 5.3.x is not supported yet)
	MediaWiki 1.15.x 
	Semantic MediaWiki 1.5
	Halo Extension 1.5.0 


Installation:
=============
   
(1) Run:
	php {wiki-path}/extensions/SemanticGardening/maintenance/SGA_setup.php

(2) Add to your LocalSettings.php after you initialized SMWHalo:

	$phpInterpreter="<path to php executable>";
	require_once("extensions/SemanticGardening/includes/SGA_GardeningInitialize.php");

(3) Specify a temporary directory by setting $sgaTempDir to a directory
    where PHP has read/write access. If none is specified, 
    then c:\temp\wiki or /tmp/wiki is used on Windows respectively on Linux.
    
(4) To specify the gardening privilege, add:

	$wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['gardening'] = true;
	
(5) This is OPTIONAL: Install the patch for SMW. It makes sure that query tables containing gardening issues
    can be sorted properly.
            
        (a) Download the latest version of Deployment Framework to install the patches:
              https://sourceforge.net/projects/halo-extension/files/deployment-1.3.1.zip/download
        
        (b) Extract the zip-file into the MediaWiki roots folder
        
        (c) Open a command-line interface to install the patches
             The file patch.txt is an Eclipse patch file which can be installed using the
             tool patch.php from the deploy framework which itself uses GNU patch. The
             file is located in the directory 'extensions\SemanticGardening'.
        
        (d) Enter the following command:
             php patch.php -p patch_for_SMW1.5.6.txt -d <mw-dir> --onlypatch
             replace <mw-dir> with the absolute path of your Mediawiki installation.
    
Options:
========

1.
$sgagGardeningBotDelay=<time in ms>
Enforces a delay to diminish the server load. 

2.
$sgagLocalGardening=true;  
Enables local gardening. That creates gardening jobs when a page has been saved. 
We do not recomment to make use of that option since it decreases the Wiki's performance.

3.
$sgagDedicatedGardeningMachine="<host or IP>";
Specify a dedicated machine for the gardening bots.

4. (for debugging)
Keeps the cmd console open on Windows after the bot has terminated.
$sgagKeepGardeningConsole=true;
