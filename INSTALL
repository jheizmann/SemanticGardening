Installation instructions for Semantic Gardening extension v1.31
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.15 or higher
    SMW 1.5
    SMWHalo 1.5 

Installation:
=============
   
Run:
php {wiki-path}/extensions/SemanticGardening/maintenance/SGA_setup.php

Then add to your LocalSettings.php after you initialized SMWHalo:

$phpInterpreter="<path to php executable>";
require_once("extensions/SemanticGardening/includes/SGA_GardeningInitialize.php");

OPTIONAL: If you want to use the 'ExportOntologyBot' you have to create a directory
    'wikiexport' in the directory $IP/extensions/SemanticGardening/. The directory must have write access for
    the user which runs Apache (or simply for all if possible).
    
Options:
========

1.
$sgagGardeningBotDelay=<time in ms>
Enforces a delay to diminish the server load. 

2.
$sgagLocalGardening=true;

3.
$sgagDedicatedGardeningMachine="<host or IP>";
Specify a dedicated machine for the gardening bots.

4. (for debugging)
Keeps the cmd console open on Windows after the bot has terminated.
